I have been interested in efficient markets for a while.  Where sports betting in now legal in about 30 states, I have started to look at how pricing (point spreads, odds, money lines, etc.) differs across different market makers (bookmakers).  By looking at pricing differences, bettors may be able to shop around for the best lines.  On the other side of the equation, bookmakers can can see where the market is at to either adjust their pricing to fall more in line with the market or to attract more action.

I have been working with the API from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/).  Depending what is in season at that time, they offer odds on 30 to 50 different sports across the globe.  Their market depth is over 50 bookmakers across the US, the UK, Europe and Australia.  They offer a free [API key](https://the-odds-api.com/#get-access) which limits you to 500 request per month or you can pay for a monthly subscription with much higher limits.

I have started by individually mapping out a few of the sports they offer.  Currently, my plan is to map out more sports, particularly ones that I am less familiar with like Cricket and outright futures markets like the winner of the next Super Bowl.  From there, I might try to combine my work into something more interactive.
